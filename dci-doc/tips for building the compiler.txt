When testing, remember to run the version you just built, don't just run `tsc somefile.ts` (which will run whatever version of `tsc` is currently configured in your shell)!

e.g. run:

  node built/local/tsc.js /path/to/your/file.ts

====

The .generated.ts files are not regenerated just by running `jake local`; it's necessary to run `jake run-syntax-generator`.

The run-syntax-generator task is a bit tricky because it relies on a working compiler in the built/local directory in order to do its job. This can result in a catch-22 where you've made a change to src/compiler/syntax/syntaxGenerator.ts that would resolve an error you're currently getting for a change you recently made to any of the other .ts files, but it's still trying to use the files you generated previously BEFORE it can run the run-syntax-generator task.

*** So when making changes to syntaxGenerator.ts or SyntaxGenerator.d.ts, always make those changes without changing any of the other .ts files, and run `jake run-syntax-generator` BEFORE making your other modifications and running `jake local`. ***

Solution
========

Copy syntaxGenerator.ts, syntaxGenerator.d.ts, and syntaxElement.ts *to* the official distro and then, *cd to the official distro*, then run:
jake run-syntax-generator

Make sure to copy all 3 files; the official distro's version of syntaxGenerator.ts doesn't support Mac properly (see comments at bottom of syntaxGenerator.ts for details).

Then copy the .generated files back to typescript-dci.

Note that this will only work once unless you restore all the .generated files back to their original versions in the official distro, or just re-download the official distro, before doing this procedure again.


OR
In some cases, just copying all the .generated files in src/compiler/syntax *from* from the official distro may be sufficient, then (from the DCI version) run:
jake run-syntax-generator

Also maybe helpful:
In Jakefile, set useBuiltCompiler to false
---

NOTE:
Sometimes syntax-generator appears to work the first time, then doesn't work when you run it again immediately afterward, apparently because the first time it might use the already-generated files, but not the second time.


Note on src/compiler/typecheck/pullTypeResolution.ts
====================================================
Be careful with changes to this file. Because type checking warnings can prevent a script from compiling, changing this file incorrectly could potentially prevent the compiler from being able to compile *itself*.

In other words, you could find that `jake local` compiles successfully, and that your newly compiled built/local/tsc.js file works fine to compile DCI code, HOWEVER, you could find that after the next time you run `jake LKG`, `jake local` will no longer compile successfully. The quick fix is to overwrite bin/tsc.js with the one from the official distro, but then obviously bin/tsc.js can no longer compile DCI code. At that point, you will need to fix the bug in src/compiler/typecheck/pullTypeResolution.ts that was causing type checking warnings to be thrown erroneously so that you can run `jake local` followed by `jake LKG` and the compiler will once again be able to compile itself.
